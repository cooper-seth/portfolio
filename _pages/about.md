# TL;DR
I am an aspiring data scientist working at AFL Telecommunications as a research analyst. Concurrently, I am pursuing my M.S. in Analytics at Georgia Institute of Technology.  Originally from Pennsylvania, I live in Upstate South Carolina with my wife, Maggie, and our dog, Charlie. Before Tech, my undergraduate education consisted of a B.S. in Business Administration - Data Analytics from Presbyterian College where I developed an understanding of business processes, analytical thinking, and R programming. 
This site is my portfolio! Throughout, you'll find details about my career, education, and various projects I've completed over the years. Most of these projects are either from school or personal ones I did for fun. Due to NDAs, I can't share specific work examples. 

# A Future as a Data Scientist 

I have always had a love for numbers and patterns, and transforming raw data into something that can be used to garner insights into the story being told by said data is very exciting to me. I was first exposed to the concepts of machine learning and the field of data science in undergrad, and I quickly became enamored with the concept. The whole reason I was originally interested in engineering was because of the prospect of using mathematics to solve complex problems, and I saw that data science would allow me to do that in a totally different and unique way. I was hooked. 

My current position is not a data science role, which is why I am pursuing a technical masters degree and spend time working on independent projects in my free time. I realize that there are fundemental skills that I will need to develop in order to transition into the roles I am interested in, and I am willing to put in the work to do so. For me, building these skills outside of the classroom involves taking MOOCs, practicing fundemental skills on Codewars, and working on Kaggle projects. I believe that in order to truly master a skill you must practice it often and not let it become lost with time. I have always learned by doing, not just sitting through a lecture and taking notes, so by consistently honing these skills during my freetime, I hope to bolster my tool belt and prepare myself for more advanced roles. By no means is this an inconvenience, in fact it's the opposite, I look forward to my future as a data scientist and I intend to enjoy the journey I take to get there. 

# Working as a Research Analyst
During the summer of my junior year, I interned with a finance located in Greenville, SC as a data strategy analyst. Here I was exposed to writing queries in SQL, building data pipelines using real-world data, building internal reports for different functional areas of an organization, and communicating key results to stakeholders. The experience solidified my interest in a data-centered career and set me on a path that got me to my current role. While I enjoyed many aspects of the company, for personal reasons I decided to turn down full-time employment following graduation and instead began applying for different positions. This is what led me to AFL Telecommunications, where I am currently employed. 
In January 2023 I accepted a part-time role with AFL's Market Strategy and Innovation team, which became a full-time role upon my graduation from Presbyterian College in May. In this role, I primarily work in Excel and Power BI, but I also occasionally complete detailed statistical analyses and reports using R. My responsibilities generally include...

* Identify and provide analysis of relevant trends in market data
* Build new data pipelines for Power BI dashboards used for internal reports
* Meet with business unit leaders to discuss ways to leverage available data
* Create tools used to identify root-causes of manufacturing bottlenecks
* Develop interactive dashboards used by senior leadership (VP to C-Suite) to craft corporate strategy
* Conduct ad-hoc analyses for several functional areas of the company by request 
* Act as a liaison between the IT group and business leaders in the organization

# Studying at Presbyterian College
When I first began my undergraduate journey in 2019, I thought my future was in engineering or teaching. So, I declared a physics major with a minor in secondary education and dove in head first...and then immediately smacked my head off the bottom of the pool. That first semester I found that, while I loved mathematics and critical thinking, physics was not going to be the way I pursued my passions. I also realized, during my observations that secondary education wasn't for me.  I was lost and frantically trying to find where I truly fit. Fast forward to sophomore year and I learned about the newest concentration in the college's business department, data analytics. Intrigued by the idea, I signed up for the introduction course and the rest was history from there. 

While studying at Presbyterian College, I built a strong foundation of analytical skills, an understanding of business functions and processes, and a broad knowledge of various other subjects. Some key topics I studied included:

* Data Analytics
* Statistics
* Calculus
* Finance
* Economics
* Cost and Managerial Accounting
* Organization Behaviour 

I also completed a multi-semester research project which culminated in a paper that I was able to present at the annual Southeastern Data Science Institure (SEDSI) conference in Willmington, NC. I was awarded first place in the undergraduate research paper competition which included a monetary prize as well as recognition during the post-conference dinner. The paper, titled "Examining the Effects of Faculty Salary and Work Experience on Student Outcomes at Southern 4-Year Colleges and Universities," is available on this site. 

While in college I also held several positions. During my senior year, I was co-leader of a faith-based peer mentorship group known as Bluefish. In this role I conducted training sessions, planned retreats, and provided mentorship services to my peers. I was also inducted as a member of Sigma Beta Delta, a national honor society for business majors. Lastly, for my final two years at P.C. I was department assistant for the Department of Economics and Business Administration. In this role, I tutored peers, provided insights on data provided by the department, assisted professors with their duties such a creating and grading assignments, and helped coordinate intern pipelines and recruitment events for the department.
