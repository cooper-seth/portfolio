# TL;DR
I am an aspiring data scientist working at AFL Telecommunications as a research analyst. Concurrently, I am pursuing my M.S. in Analytics at Georgia Institute of Technology.  Originally from Pennsylvania, I live in Upstate South Carolina with my wife, Maggie, and our dog, Charlie. Before Tech, my undergraduate education consisted of a B.S. in Business Administration - Data Analytics from Presbyterian College where I developed an understanding of business processes, analytical thinking, and R programming. 
This site is my portfolio! Throughout, you'll find details about my career, education, and various projects I've completed over the years. Most of these projects are either from school or personal ones I did for fun. Due to NDAs, I can't share specific work examples. 

# Undergraduate Background
When I first began my college journey in 2019, I thought my future was in engineering or teaching. So, I declared a physics major with a minor in secondary education and dove in head first...and then immediately smacked my head off the bottom of the pool. That first semester I found that, while I loved mathematics and critical thinking, physics was not going to be the way I pursued my passions. I also realized, during my observations that secondary education wasn't for me.  I was lost and frantically trying to find where I truly fit. Fast forward to sophomore year and I learned about the newest concentration in the college's business department, data analytics. Intrigued by the idea, I signed up for the introduction course and the rest was history from there. 

# Working as a Research Analyst
During the summer of my junior year, I interned with a finance located in Greenville, SC as a data strategy analyst. Here I was exposed to writing queries in SQL, building data pipelines using real-world data, building internal reports for different functional areas of an organization, and communicating key results to stakeholders. The experience solidified my interest in a data-centered career and set me on a path that got me to my current role. While I enjoyed many aspects of the company, for personal reasons I decided to turn down full-time employment following graduation and instead began applying for different positions. This is what led me to AFL Telecommunications, where I am currently employed. 
In January 2023 I accepted a part-time role with AFL's Market Strategy and Innovation team, which became a full-time role upon my graduation from Presbyterian College in May. In this role, I primarily work in Excel and Power BI, but I also occasionally complete detailed statistical analyses and reports using R. My responsibilities generally include...

* Identify and provide analysis of relevant trends in market data
* Build new data pipelines for Power BI dashboards used for internal reports
* Meet with business unit leaders to discuss ways to leverage available data
* Create tools used to identify root-causes of manufacturing bottlenecks
* Develop interactive dashboards used by senior leadership (VP to C-Suite) to craft corporate strategy
* Conduct ad-hoc analyses for several functional areas of the company by request 
* Act as a liaison between the IT group and business leaders in the organization
